# About:
Feel nostalgic when you hear an old video game's music? If so, 8-Bit Music Maker is here to let you re-live those memories! It's packed with 8-Bit sounds from the past, and filled with endless possibilities of songs (some creativity required)! This playground is the perfect place to be creative, and bring out your inner child.

### Inspiration:
_While I wasn't born in the 80's, I spent a lot of my childhood playing older generation video games which were handed down to me. Some of these games have brought me joy to this day!_

### Resources:
The resources found in this playground were all created by me. I developed the C note samples in [Garage Band.app](https://www.apple.com/ca/mac/garageband/) using an [8-Bit plugin](http://www.ymck.net/en/download/magical8bitplug/). I drew all the pixel art in [Pixen.app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixen/id525180431?mt=12) which is available on the Mac App Store.

## Live Sequencing 🎼:
Utilizing the powerful `AVAudioEngine`, the 8-Bit Music Maker supports live note sequencing! This means as the Bit Music maker is sequencing you can toggle notes on and off in real time!

## Instruments 🎹:
8-Bit Music Maker supports 3 different "wave forms", or "instruments", as I like to refer to them. While these are not the only wave forms supported in 8-bit architectures, they were certainly the most popular in 80's video games. Take a look at the `Instrument` type!

`⌥ + click` it!

let instrumentEnum: Instrument

Go ahead and inspect each of the following images if you'd like an idea what each wave form looks like:

let squareWave = UIImage(instrumentForWave: .square)
let triangleWave = UIImage(instrumentForWave: .triangle)
let noiseWave = UIImage(instrumentForWave: .noise)
