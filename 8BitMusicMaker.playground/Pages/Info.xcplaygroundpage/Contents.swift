# About:
Feel nostalgic when you hear an old video game's music? If so, 8-Bit Music Maker is here to let you re-live those memories! It's packed with 8-Bit sounds from the past, and filled with endless possibilities of songs (some creativity required)! This playground is the perfect place to be creative, and bring out your inner child.

### Inspiration:
_While I wasn't born in the 80's, growing up I spent a lot of my childhood playing older generation videogames which were handed down to me. Some of these games have brought me joy to this day!_

### Resources:
The resources found in this playground were all created by me. I developed the C note samples in [Garage Band.app](https://www.apple.com/ca/mac/garageband/) using an [8-Bit plugin](http://www.ymck.net/en/download/magical8bitplug/). I drew all the pixel art in [Pixen.app](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/pixen/id525180431?mt=12) which is avaliable on the Mac App Store.
