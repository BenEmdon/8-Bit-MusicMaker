# About:
Feel nostalgic when you hear an old video games music? If so, 8-Bit Music Maker is here to let you re-live those memories! It's packed with the 8-Bit sounds from the past, and filled with endless possible songs (some creativity required)! This playground app is the perfect place to be creative, and bring out your inner childhood.

### Inspiration:
_While I wasn't born in the 80's, growing up I spent a lot of my childhood playing older generation videogames as they were handed down to me. Some of these games have brought me joy to this day!_
